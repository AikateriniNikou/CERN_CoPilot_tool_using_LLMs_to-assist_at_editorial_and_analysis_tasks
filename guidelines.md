## 1: General Style and Structure
 
### Titles and Abstracts
 
Does the abstract a) include CMS (accompanied by either "Collaboration", "experiment", or "detector") and either "LHC" or "CERN LHC", b) state the type of beams, the center-of-mass energy,  c) the integrated luminosity, and d) give the main result(s), including statistical and systematic uncertainties if appropriate. If not, flag this.
 
Is the calendar year(s) in which the data were collected stated? If not, flag this.
 
- Abstracts:
  - <200 words (or <100 for PRL)
  - Self-contained, short, and impactful
 
---
 
## 2: Language, Grammar, and Word Choice
 
### Plagiarism and Consistency
 
- Avoid self-plagiarism: paraphrase and cite.
- Use consistent UK or US spelling.
- Prefer -ize endings.
 
### Style and Grammar
 
- Avoid contractions.
- Use appropriate articles based on sound.
- Do not end sentences with prepositions unnecessarily.
- “Its” = possessive, “it’s” is never used.
 
### Preferred Word Usage
 
- “Current” not “actual”
- “In agreement” not “very good agreement”
- “Charged particle tracks” not “tracks”
- “Systematic uncertainty” not “systematics”
- Avoid jargon like “beamspot”, “fake lepton”, “top/Higgs tagging”

## 3: Hyphenation and Punctuation

Hyphens should be used to increase clarity. The trend in scientific writing is to avoid a hyphen when it does not serve a useful purpose, e.g. "pileup", "top quark decays", "b quark jet".
The recommendations given here are intended for guidance. As always, improved clarity is the overriding principle in case of doubt.

**Hyphenation conventions for commonly used or troublesome terms**
**Two or more words, unhyphenated**
|b jet                |beam halo particles       |heavy ions                  |jet energy corrections      |standard model             |$x$ axis           |

|b tag                |charged particle tracks   |Higgs boson mass            |lead tungstate              |top quark decays           |                   |
|b tagging            |colour singlet state      |in the $t$ channel          |Monte Carlo                 |W boson                    |                   |

**Use a hyphen**
The following should be hyphenated as attributive adjectives
(an attributive adjective is an adjective that comes before the noun that it is describing or qualifying):

   * A noun + present or past participle: "gas-filled chambers", "English-speaking people", "U-shaped tube";

   * Some combinations form passive verb forms, so they must be hyphenated to show they are performing as a unit, e.g. "Doppler-shifted", "Fourier-transformed";

   * An adjective + present or past participle: "good-sized sample", "straight-sided cavern", "fine-grained texture";

   * "Well", "ill", or "little" + past participle: "well-known theorem", "ill-defined terms", "little-known result", but do not hyphenate if the adjective is modified by an adverb: "very well known theorem", "extremely fine grained texture";

   * A preposition + noun or adjective: "near-surface reaction", "near-death experience", "next-to-leading-order calculation" (but "calculated to next-to-leading order");

   * Temporary compounds formed by an adjective + noun indicating number, dimension, or quality: "single-photon approximation", "three-component gas", "nth-order equation", "low-\pt region". %BR%
If a combination that would normally require a hyphen is modified by an adverb, a hyphen is not used: "high-\pt particles", but "very high \pt particles".

**Do NOT use a hyphen** 
The following combinations should NOT be hyphenated as attributive adjectives:

   * An irregular comparative or superlative + participle or noun: "best known result", "least known theorem";

   * Foreign phrases: "a priori solution", "in situ technique";

   * Adverbs ending in "ly" + adjective or participle: "slowly flowing gas", "highly complex approach", "oppositely charged particles";

   * Chemical compounds: "sulfuric acid bath", "carbon dioxide gas", "lead tungstate crystals";

   * Compounds indicating direction or placement: "upper right corner", "north central Switzerland";

   * Temporary compounds used as attributive adjectives formed by a noun + noun: "energy flow region", "wake surface potential", "jet energy corrections";

   * Permanent compounds (frequently used word combinations) that have their own (unhyphenated) dictionary entries: "Higgs boson", "Z boson", "W boson", "top quark", "cross section", "standard model", "black hole", "cosmic ray", "magnetic field", "form factor", "maximum likelihood fit"  ; 

   * Other combinations of an adjective + noun that may be considered permanent because of their common usage in our field: "b quark", "b tagging", tau lepton, "$S$ wave";

   * Comparative modifiers using "more" or "less" do not need hyphens except on the rare occasions when the meaning is ambiguous without one, for example, "the more common approach", "the less known algorithm".

**Usually use a hyphen**
The following category of attributive adjectives usually take a hyphen, but some recommendations
or journal guidelines will differ:

   * Phrases that act as attributive modifiers: "signal-to-noise ratio", "order-of-magnitude estimate", "tag-and-probe procedure".

**Always use a hyphen**
   * Phrases that are listed in the dictionary with hyphens should always use them: "day-to-day variation", "one-to-one correspondence".

**Nouns**
   * Do not hyphenate a noun + gerund or fractions when they act as nouns in a sentence: "problem solving", "data taking", "one half", "two thirds", but do hyphenate them when they are used as an adjective, e.g. "data-taking period", "two-thirds full";

   * Use a hyphen with "self" compounds and a verb + preposition (acting as a noun): "self-destruct", "turn-on", "ramp-up".

**Words of equal weight** A hyphen is used to connect words of equal weight. Usually, they are connected because they have an "either-or", "from-to", or "between-and" relationship: "wave-particle duality", "argon-ethane gas", "time-space plot", "May-December relationship".

**En dashes and em dashes**
Use an en dash (a double hyphen "--" in !LaTeX, with no spaces between it and the items on either side) to indicate a range of values, e.g. "5--10", or something attributed to two people, e.g. "Bose--Einstein correlations".
Use an em dash (a triple hyphen "---" in !LaTeX, with no spaces between it and the words on either side) for an article of punctuation, e.g. "The measurement failed---we messed it up."
The em dash is also used to bring more emphasis to a comment than it would receive if placed in parentheses or in a clause set off by commas.  For example, compare
"Additional leptons, if present, result in a negligible increase in the background." with
"Additional leptons---if present---result in a negligible increase in the background."

**Two related hyphenated words near each other**
If you have two related hyphenated words near each other in a sentence, you can shorten the first hyphenated word by omitting the hyphenated part and leaving a hyphen at the end of it.  Example: "Both initial- and final-state radiation are taken into account."

## 4: Numbers and Mathematics
 
- Spell out integers ≤10 unless with units/equations.
- Use numerals with:
  - Units
  - Math
  - Section references
- Never start a sentence with a numeral.
 
### Formatting
 
- Thin space for 5-digit+ numbers: `\,`
- Scientific notation: use `\times` not `\cdot`
- Percentages: `(94.3 ± 1.3)%`, `2--3%`
- Use math mode for symbols: `${>}60\GeV`
- Prefer `$0.9 < \abs{y} < 1.25$` over two-sided
 
---
 
## 5: Acronyms and Symbols
 
- Define in abstract, body, and summary if reused.
- Avoid acronyms in titles or sentence starts.
- Standard CMS macros:
  - `\CL`, `\PW`, `\PGm`, `\ptmiss`, `\ptvecmiss`
- Use roman subscripts: `$k_{\text{T}}$`
- Do not reuse symbols for multiple concepts.
 
### Math and Units
 
- Quantities in italics, units in roman (`\unit{...}`)
- Use CMS macros: `\GeV`, `\GeVns`, `\percms`, `\fbinv`
- Write ratios like `$E/pc$`
- Use natural units if applicable
 
---
 
## 6: Figures and Tables
 
- Use CMS plotting macros; remove “Preliminary” from journals.
- Always show `\sqrt{s}` and luminosity on data plots.
- Use vector graphics (PDF preferred).
- Store macros/scripts in GitLab.
- Captions:
  - Below figures
  - Above tables (`\topcaption`)
- Label axes with units.
- Use Poisson error bars for low stats.
- Make plots colorblind-friendly.
- Avoid (a), (b) labels unless embedded.
 
---
 
## 7: Abstracts and Headings
 
- Avoid CMS/LHC in title unless essential.
- Use up to four heading levels.
- Start final section with **Summary**, unless **Conclusions** is justified.
- Only capitalize first word and proper nouns.
- Use `~` to prevent line breaks on references/figures.
 
---
 
## 8: Language Specifics
 
- Monte Carlo is an adjective: “Monte Carlo simulation”
- Say “W boson decay” not “W decay”
- Use full terms: Higgs boson, tau lepton, top antiquark
- Be precise:
  - “larger data sample” not “higher statistics”
  - “uncertainty in” not “on”
  - “error” only for mistakes
 
---
 
## 9: Supplementary Material and Citations
 
### Supplementary Material (SM)
 
- Only for critical updates post-submission.
- Use appendices unless separate SM required.
- For arXiv: include in single PDF.
- For journal: submit separate PDF.
 
### Citing and Referencing
 
- Cite peer-reviewed papers when available.
- Cite:
  - Theory
  - Methods
  - Prior CMS results
- Use CDS links for CMS papers.
- Cite the trigger paper if using collider data.
 
### BibTeX Rules
 
- Use `{CMS Collaboration}` as author.
- Protect capitalized words with `{}`.
- Use correct types: `@article`, `@TECHREPORT`, etc.
- Cite only the start page, omit issue numbers.
 
---
 
## 10: LaTeX and Document Repositories
 
- Use CMS LaTeX templates.
- Update both GitLab and CADI PDFs.
- Do not format for journal styles in GitLab/CADI.
